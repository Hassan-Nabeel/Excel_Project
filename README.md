## 3. Bank Loan

Objective:
  Clients wants to create a two Dashboard i.e, Bank Summary and Bank Overview Dasboard so that they can have insight on the below requirements-
 DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY
 Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
  1. Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
  2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
  3.  Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MT D) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over- Month (MoM) changes.
  4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MT D, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
  5. Average Debt-to-income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health.  We need to compute the average DTI for and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

 Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI's
 Good Loan:
  1.	Good Loan Application Percentage
  2.	Good Loan Applications
  3.	Good Loan Funded Amount
  4.	Good Loan Total Received Amount

 Bad Loan:
  1.	Bad Loan Application Percentage
  2.	Bad Loan Applications
  3.	Bad Loan Funded Amount
  4.	Bad Loan Total Received Amount

 Loan Status Grid View
  In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim
  to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.' By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan
  Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD
  Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us
  to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.
