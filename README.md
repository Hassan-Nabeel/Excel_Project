## 3. Bank Loan

 Objective:

 - The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for
 accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan
 portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
 - Clients wants to create a two Dashboard i.e, Bank Summary and Bank Overview Dasboard so that they can have insight on the below requirements-
  
 DASHBOARD 1: SUMMARY
 
  Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Requirements:
   1. Total Loan Applications: We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
   2. Total Funded Amount: Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
   3.  Total Amount Received: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MT D) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over- Month (MoM) changes.
   4. Average Interest Rate: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MT D, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
   5. Average Debt-to-income Ratio (DTI): Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health.  We need to compute the average DTI for and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.

 Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI's
 
  Good Loan:
   1.	Good Loan Application Percentage
   2.	Good Loan Applications
   3.	Good Loan Funded Amount
   4.	Good Loan Total Received Amount

  Bad Loan:
   1.	Bad Loan Application Percentage
   2.	Bad Loan Applications
   3.	Bad Loan Funded Amount
   4.	Bad Loan Total Received Amount

 Loan Status Grid View
 
   In order to gain a comprehensive overview of our lending operations and monitor the performance of loans, we aim
   to create a grid view report categorized by 'Loan Status.' By providing insights into metrics such as 'Total Loan
   Applications,' 'Total Funded Amount,' 'Total Amount Received,' 'Month-to-Date (MTD) Funded Amount,' 'MTD
   Amount Received,' 'Average Interest Rate,' and 'Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI),' this grid view will empower us
   to make data-driven decisions and assess the health of our loan portfolio.



 DASHBOARD 2: OVERVIEW

 CHARTS
  1. Monthly Trends by Issue Date (Line Chart): To identify seasonality and long-term trends in lending activities.
  2.  Regional Analysis by State (Filled Map): To identify regions with significant lending activity and assess regional
  Disparities.
  3. Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart): To allow the client to understand the distribution of loans across various term
  lengths.
  4. Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart): How lending metrics are distributed among borrowers with different
  employment lengths, helping us assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
  5. Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart): Will provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes of loans, aiding in the understanding of the primary reasons borrowers seek financing.
  6. Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map): For a hierarchical view of how home ownership impacts loan applications and disbursements.
  Metric to be shown: 'Total Loan Application', ‘Total Funded Amount’ and 'Total Amount Received'
